- Hi, I’m dpshibby
- I’m interested in learning about operating systems, embedded programming, compilers, and hobbyist gamedev
- I’m currently learning 6502 assembly and making NES games as well as studying OS and embedded in my free time

I set up this github account to be separate from my old school account and put personal projects on it.
